# README

## Overview
This repository contains multiple Python scripts that demonstrate fundamental programming concepts, including arithmetic operations, boolean logic, mathematical functions, conditional statements, and user input handling.

## File Descriptions

### 1. **arithmetic_operators.py**
This script demonstrates various arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and modulus. It shows different ways to write these operations, including shorthand operators like `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, and `**=`.

### 2. **booleans_with_if.py**
This script explores boolean variables and their usage in conditional statements. It checks whether an item is for sale (`True`) or not (`False`) and prints messages accordingly. Another condition checks if an item is online (`True` or `False`).

### 3. **built_in_math_func.py**
This script demonstrates the use of Python’s built-in mathematical functions such as `round()`, `abs()`, `pow()`, `max()`, and `min()` to perform basic mathematical operations.

### 4. **circumference.py**
This script calculates the circumference and area of a circle based on user input for the radius. It makes use of the `math` module for precision in calculations.

### 5. **condition.py**
This script prompts the user to input their age and categorizes them into different groups: minor, adult, or senior citizen. It also handles invalid age inputs.

### 6. **condition2.py**
This script asks the user if they would like food (`Y/N`). If the response is 'Y', it prints "OK"; otherwise, it displays "GET LOST."

### 7. **condition3.py**
This script prompts the user to enter their name. If the user fails to input a name, it returns an error message; otherwise, it greets them with a personalized message.

### 8. **math_function2.py**
This script demonstrates the usage of Python’s `math` module, including constants like `math.pi` and `math.e`, and functions like `math.sqrt()`, `math.ceil()`, and `math.floor()`.

## How to Run the Scripts
Each script can be run individually using Python. Ensure that you have Python installed on your system, then execute the desired script using the following command:

```sh
python script_name.py
```

For example:
```sh
python circumference.py
```

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- `math` module (built-in Python module)

## Conclusion
These scripts serve as basic examples to understand core Python programming concepts. They can be expanded or modified as needed for learning or project development.
