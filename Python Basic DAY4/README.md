# Python Logical Operations & User Input Handling

## Overview
This project contains multiple Python scripts demonstrating the use of logical operations (`or`, `and`, `not`), string manipulations, conditional checks, and unit conversions. The scripts include:

1. **Logical Operators in Decision Making**
2. **String Operations and Input Processing**
3. **Username Validation**
4. **Temperature Unit Conversion**
5. **Weight Unit Conversion**

## 1. Logical Operators in Decision Making
This script demonstrates how logical operators control program flow:
- Cancelling an outdoor event based on temperature and weather conditions.
- Checking stock availability of a product based on quantity and sale status.

### Key Concepts:
- `or`: At least one condition must be `True`.
- `and`: All conditions must be `True`.
- `not`: Inverts the Boolean value.

---

## 2. String Operations and Input Processing
This script covers various string manipulation functions:
- Finding the length of a string.
- Searching for characters (`find`, `rfind`).
- Changing case (`capitalize`, `upper`, `lower`).
- Checking if a string is numeric (`isdigit`) or alphabetical (`isalpha`).
- Counting occurrences of a character.
- Replacing characters in a string.

---

## 3. Username Validation
This script ensures a valid username by:
- Restricting usernames to 12 characters.
- Preventing spaces in the username.
- Allowing only alphabetical characters.

---

## 4. Temperature Unit Conversion
This script converts temperature between Celsius and Fahrenheit:
- Converts Celsius to Fahrenheit using: `F = (9/5) * C + 32`.
- Converts Fahrenheit to Celsius using: `C = (F - 32) * 5/9`.
- Handles invalid inputs.

---

## 5. Weight Unit Conversion
This script converts weight between kilograms and pounds:
- Converts kilograms to pounds using: `lbs = kg * 2.205`.
- Converts pounds to kilograms using: `kg = lbs / 2.205`.
- Handles invalid inputs.

---

## How to Run the Scripts
1. Ensure Python (Python 3 recommended) is installed.
2. Save each script as a `.py` file (e.g., `temperature_converter.py`, `username_validator.py`).
3. Run the script using:
   ```sh
   python filename.py
   ```

---

## Possible Enhancements
- Add exception handling for invalid inputs.
- Use functions to improve code reusability.
- Implement graphical user interface (GUI) for user-friendly interaction.
