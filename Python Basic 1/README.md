# Project README

## Overview
This project contains two Python scripts:
1. **main.py** - A simple script that prints motivational messages.
2. **Typecasting.py** - A script demonstrating typecasting (converting variables between different data types) in Python.
3. **Variables.py** - A script demonstrating use of types of variables such as string , int , bool etc.
---

## File Descriptions
### 1. main.py
- Purpose: This script serves as a basic introduction to Python by printing simple messages.
- Output:
  ```
  Hello Billionaire
  Future is bright
  ```

### 2. Typecasting.py
- Purpose: Demonstrates how to convert variables between different data types in Python.
- Covered conversions:
  - `str()` - Converts to string
  - `int()` - Converts to integer
  - `float()` - Converts to float
  - `bool()` - Converts to boolean

- Example variables used:
  ```python
  name = "krish kotadia"
  age = 18
  gpa = 9.9
  is_student = True
  ```

- Output includes type checks before and after conversion, showing how Python handles typecasting.

---

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3+).
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Run the scripts using:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   python Typecasting.py
   ```

---

## Requirements
- Python 3+

---

## Notes
- Ensure `variables.py` exists in the same directory as `Typecasting.py` since it imports `is_student` from that file.
- Typecasting behavior can vary, so be cautious when converting between types.
